# mangadex-reader
Simple python script to access Mangadex v5 API.

You will need the `requests` module, and while not necessary, the `termcolor` module is highly recommended to improve readability. Finally, you need to get your JWT access token and replace it in the beginning of the script.

Arrow keys to navigate, esc and enter key to select/exit.
